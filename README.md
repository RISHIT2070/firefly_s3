# Terraform S3 Bucket Module

This Terraform module creates an S3 bucket with versioning enabled and prevents accidental deletion using the `lifecycle` block.

## Usage

To use this module, include the following code in your Terraform configuration:

```
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3_bucket"

  bucket_name = "my-bucket"
  region      = "us-west-2"
}
```

Replace `my-bucket` and `us-west-2` with your desired bucket name and region.

## Useful Commands

* `terraform init`: Initialize the Terraform configuration.
* `terraform apply`: Create or update the S3 bucket.
* `terraform destroy`: Destroy the S3 bucket.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3_bucket"

  bucket_name = "my-bucket"
  region      = "us-west-2"
}
```

### Example 2: Advanced Usage

```
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3_bucket"

  bucket_name = "my-bucket"
  region      = "us-west-2"
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value = module.s3_bucket.bucket_name
}
```

## Outputs

* `bucket_name`: The name of the S3 bucket created by this module.
