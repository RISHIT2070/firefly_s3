# Terraform S3 Bucket Module

This Terraform module creates an S3 bucket with versioning enabled and prevents accidental deletion using the `lifecycle` block.

## Usage

To use this module, include the following code in your Terraform configuration:

```
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3_bucket"

  bucket_name = "my-bucket"
  region      = "us-west-2"
}
```

Replace `my-bucket` and `us-west-2` with your desired bucket name and region.

## Useful Commands

* `terraform init`: Initialize the Terraform configuration.
* `terraform apply`: Create or update the S3 bucket.
* `terraform destroy`: Destroy the S3 bucket.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3_bucket"

  bucket_name = "my-bucket"
  region      = "us-west-2"
}
```

### Example 2: Advanced Usage

```
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3_bucket"

  bucket_name = "my-bucket"
  region      = "us-west-2"
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value = module.s3_bucket.bucket_name
}
```

## Outputs

* `bucket_name`: The name of the S3 bucket created by this module.

# Terraform S3 Bucket Module

This Terraform module creates an S3 bucket with versioning enabled and prevents accidental deletion.

## Usage

To use this module, include the following code in your Terraform configuration:

```terraform
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3_bucket"

  bucket_name = "aws_bucket_rishit"
  region      = "ap-south-1"
}
```

Replace `aws_bucket_rishit` with the desired name of your S3 bucket and `ap-south-1` with the desired AWS region.

## Variables

- `bucket_name`: The name of the S3 bucket to create.
- `region`: The AWS region in which to create the S3 bucket.

## Outputs

- `bucket_name`: The name of the created S3 bucket.
- `bucket_arn`: The ARN of the created S3 bucket.

## Useful Commands

- `terraform init`: Initialize the Terraform configuration.
- `terraform plan`: Preview the changes to be made by the Terraform configuration.
- `terraform apply`: Apply the Terraform configuration and create the S3 bucket.
- `terraform destroy`: Destroy the S3 bucket and remove all associated resources.

## Example

```terraform
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "./modules/s3_bucket"

  bucket_name = "aws_bucket_rishit"
  region      = "ap-south-1"
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value = module.s3_bucket.bucket_name
}

output "bucket_arn" {
  value = module.s3_bucket.bucket_arn
}

# S3 Bucket Terraform Module

This Terraform module creates an S3 bucket with a unique name specified by the `bucket_name_RISHIT` variable.

## Usage

To use this module, include the following code in your Terraform configuration:

```terraform
module "s3_bucket_RISHIT" {
  source = "./s3_bucket_RISHIT"

  bucket_name_RISHIT = "my-unique-bucket-name"
}

output "bucket_arn_RISHIT" {
  value = module.s3_bucket_RISHIT.bucket_arn
}
```

## Variables

- `bucket_name_RISHIT`: (Required) The name of the S3 bucket to create.

## Outputs

- `bucket_arn_RISHIT`: The ARN of the created S3 bucket.

## Example

```terraform
module "s3_bucket_RISHIT" {
  source = "./s3_bucket_RISHIT"

  bucket_name_RISHIT = "my-unique-bucket-name"
}

output "bucket_arn_RISHIT" {
  value = module.s3_bucket_RISHIT.bucket_arn
}
```
